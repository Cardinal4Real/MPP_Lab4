For p1.equals(p2), p1 is a PersonWithJob which is a subclass of Person and p2 is of type Person which is the parent class itself. However, in the equals method that has been overridden in PersonWithJob (p1's instance), it is checking if the next object being compared is an instance of it's class (the subclass). Since p2 which is of the parent class Person is NOT a subclass, it returns a false!
